"Explain that they can either contact the journal to change license to CC BY, or publish initial and revised preprints","Based on the information you provided, you have the option to comply with either HHMI's 2022 Open Access to Publications policy or HHMI's 2026 Immediate Access to Research policy. Choose one of the following: 
1. Choose CC BY as the license for the journal article (or, if you already selected a different license, contact the journal to change the license to CC BY). You can find out which license you selected by checking the license agreement that you signed. The license agreement should include ""Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,"" ""CC BY,"" or similar language. It should not display licenses with additional restrictions such as CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND. 
2. If the journal article is not yet published, you can instead publish initial and revised preprints of your manuscript on a preprint server. 
 
If you choose the preprint option, bioRxiv is the preferred designated preprint server for HHMI articles. Articles that are out of scope for bioRxiv can be published on medRxiv (clinical medicine), ChemRxiv, (chemistry) or arXiv (computer science and physics). When you are asked to choose a license, choose CC BY. Then, when you revise your manuscript based on peer feedback or new results or analysis, return to the preprint server and publish a revised version under a CC BY license. At least one revised preprint version is required before the article appears in a journal."
Contact the journal to change license to CC BY,"Based on the information you provided, we recommend that you follow HHMI's 2022 Open Access to Publications policy. To comply with this policy, you should choose CC BY as the license for the journal article (or, if you have already made your license selection, contact the journal to change the license to CC BY). You can verify that you have selected the correct license by checking the license agreement that you signed. The license agreement should include ""Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,"" ""CC BY,"" or similar language. It should not display licenses with additional restrictions such as CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND."
Figure out OA status and come back later,"Based on the information you provided, your next steps for compliance will depend on whether you selected or plan to select an open access publishing option at the journal. **HHMI does not require you to select an open access option**, but letting us know which option you plan to choose will allow us to support you with PubMed Central submission if needed. Once you determine which option you chose or plan to choose at the journal, you can modify your responses above to receive guidance on next steps. 
 
If you have already submitted your paper to a journal, you can determine the open access status of your paper by contacting the person who made the submission and/or handled any fees associated with this submission. If the journal charged an open access fee and you have paid or plan to pay this fee, you should select ""yes"" for the open access question above. 
 
For additional support about choosing an open access status for your paper, please contact the HHMI Open Science Team at oapolicy@hhmi.org. 
 
Here is a list of common journals selected by HHMI labs, along with their type. See the definitions and next steps for each journal type below. **HHMI does not require you to select an open access journal**, but the next steps for compliance will depend on whether the journal offers open access publishing options.

**Open access journals** publish all content on an open access basis (free to read). The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) hosts a community-curated list of open access journals: https://doaj.org/ If the journal in which you plan to publish is open access, you should select ""yes"" for the open access question above. 
 
HHMI lab budgets can be used to pay open access fees at open access journals. 
 
**Transformative journals** publish both subscription and open access content. Their publishers have publicly committed to transitioning to full open access by (a) gradually increasing the share of open access content in their journals and (b) offsetting subscription income with payments for publishing services. If the journal in which you plan to publish is transformative and you have paid or plan to pay an open access fee, you should select ""yes"" for the open access question above. If you plan to publish under the subscription option, you should select ""no."" 
 
HHMI lab budgets can be used to pay open access fees at transformative journals for papers submitted on or before December 31, 2025. 
 
**Hybrid journals** publish both subscription and open access content but have not publicly committed to transitioning to full open access. If the journal in which you plan to publish is hybrid and you have paid or plan to pay an open access fee, you should select ""yes"" for the open access question above. If you plan to publish under the subscription option, you should select ""no."" 
 
HHMI lab budgets cannot be used to pay open access fees at hybrid journals, but can be used to pay other types of fees at these journals (e.g., page/color charges). 
 
**Subscription journals** publish articles behind a paywall and under a restrictive ""rights reserved"" license to control access to their articles. If the journal in which you plan to publish is a subscription journal, you should select ""no"" for the open access question above. 
 
Subscription journals do not have open access fees, but HHMI lab budgets can be used to pay other types of fees at these journals (e.g., page/color charges)."
Figure out license and come back later,"Based on the information you provided, your next steps for compliance will depend on which license you selected or plan to select. 
 
If you plan to comply with HHMI's 2022 Open Access to Publications policy, you should choose CC BY as the license for the journal article. To verify which license you selected, visit the journal submission portal to determine which option you chose for this submission, or check the license agreement that you signed. The license agreement should include ""Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,"" ""CC BY,"" or similar language. It should not display licenses with additional restrictions such as CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND. 
 
If you have already selected or plan to select a license other than CC BY, you can modify your responses above to receive guidance on next steps.
