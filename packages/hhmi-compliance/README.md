# HHMI Compliance Extension - Planning Document

## Overview

The HHMI Compliance Extension provides tools and workflows for managing HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) open science compliance requirements. This extension integrates with existing compliance systems and provide automated workflows for tracking and managing compliance status.

HHMI compliance involves:

1. **Open Access Requirements**: HHMI requires open access copies of research published at certain outlets
2. **NIH Integration**: NIH requires all funded research to be published on PMC
3. **Compliance Tracking**: The system already has compliance tracking via Airtable integration
4. **Publication Management**: Existing PMC workflows handle some HHMI-specific requirements
